## Starting an LLC


### Pre-Flight

1. Have a credit/debit card ready
2. Use a common email address
3. Sign up for a password manager like [1Password](https://1password.com/) to store the credentials for all of your new accounts

### 1. Business Name Lookup Tools

_Prior to buying **anything** use the search tools below to make sure the business name you want is available_ 

* [California Business Search](https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/) - check to see if name is registered in California
